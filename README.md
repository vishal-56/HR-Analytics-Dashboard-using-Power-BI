## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to identify the key factors driving employee attrition and provide actionable insights to improve workforce retention within an organization.

This dashboard enables the HR team to analyze employee attrition patterns using interactive visuals and KPIs.

Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to:

- Dive deep into HR data to uncover meaningful trends.
- Build interactive dashboards using Power BI visuals.
- Deliver data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.

## üîÑ Steps Followed


### 1. **Data Gathering**
- Imported raw CSV data into Power BI.
- Used Power Query Editor for cleaning and preprocessing.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Removed empty columns, duplicates, and fixed errors.
- Replaced invalid values and standardized column naming.
- Ensured proper data types using auto-detect features.

### 3. **Data Processing**
- Created a new column `AttritionCount` using conditional logic:  
  `IF Attrition = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0`.
- Built DAX measures like:  
  `Attrition Rate = SUM([AttritionCount]) / SUM([EmployeeCount]) * 100`.

### 4. **Data Analysis**
- Created visualizations including bar charts, KPIs, pie charts, and tables.
- Used slicers and filters for interactive exploration.
